# Power BI tasks 

## 🔹Task 1: Number of Restaurants per City
 
 ## Objective:

Analyze the distribution of restaurants across different cities to identify which cities have the highest and lowest restaurant presence.
 
 ## Task Explanation:

●	Extract the total count of restaurants for each city from the dataset.

●	Use a bar chart or map visualization to display the distribution.

●	Identify trends such as high restaurant density areas and underrepresented locations.

●	Analyze whether restaurant availability correlates with city population or food demand.
 
 ## Expected Output:

A bar chart or map showing the number of restaurants per city with clear insights on restaurant density.

## 🔹Task 2: Percentage of Orders from Different Cities
 
 ## Objective:

Understand which cities contribute the most to total orders and how demand varies across regions.
 
 ## Task Explanation:

●	Aggregate the total number of orders for each city.

●	Create a pie chart to represent the percentage of total orders by city.

●	Compare the order distribution against restaurant density to check for imbalances.

●	Provide insights into which cities dominate the Zomato order market.
 
 ## Expected Output:

A pie chart that visually breaks down order distribution by city for easy comparison.

## 🔹Task 3: Order Amount Trends Over Time
 
 ## Objective:

Analyze how order amounts fluctuate over time to identify peak sales periods and slow periods.
 
 ## Task Explanation:

●	Extract date-wise order amounts from the dataset.
